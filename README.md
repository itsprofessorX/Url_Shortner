Developed a web-based URL shortening tool that allows users to input a long URL and receive a shortened version using Bitly’s API. The frontend was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a simple and user-friendly interface. The tool leverages JavaScript to interact with Bitly’s REST API, making HTTP POST requests to convert long URLs into shortened links. Implemented input validation, error handling, and dynamic link generation. The application is styled using custom CSS to ensure responsiveness and accessibility across devices.
