Developed a web-based URL shortening tool that allows users to input a long URL and receive a shortened version using **Bitly’s API.** The frontend was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, providing a simple and user-friendly interface.

The tool leverages JavaScript to interact with Bitly’s REST API, making **HTTP POST requests** to convert long URLs into shortened links.

Implemented:-

**1)** input validation

**2)** error handling

**3)** dynamic link generation


 The application is styled using custom CSS to ensure responsiveness and accessibility across devices.

UI Looks like as below:-
